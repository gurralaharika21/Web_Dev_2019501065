Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is my first website creation.
Here I have used HTML5,css,bootstrap and sass.
So I have made me about myself.
This includes 6 html files,one css file and one sass file.
The files are as follows:
*.index.html--->infor about the contents of the page
  which can navigate to 4 other html files. they are:
 1) profile which is myprofile.html--where I have included about me my likes by using css selectors like descendent selector,ordered adn unordered lists,inserted an image of mine.
 it can navigate to education and MSIT pages.
 2)Education.html page--->Here I have used bootstrap grid structure to display my images as grid.
This page is about my study life.
From here I can navigate to all the other pages through hyperlinks.
3)Favorites.html page-->which describes about my favourite people in my life and hibbes of mine.
HEre I made use of flex property.
4)Presentation.html page-->which includes about two topics like smart traffic management system and some other topics by makes use of id.
This is probably the last page of my website.
5)MSIT.html-->this is the special page which can be found in my profile page.
